# BEV-LLM: Leveraging Multimodal BEV Maps for Scene Captioning in Autonomous Driving

**Overview:** BEV-LLM is a lightweight 1B model for 3D scene captioning in autonomous driving. It fuses LiDAR and multi-view images using BEVFusion and introduces novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific descriptions. Despite its size, it performs competitively on the nuCaption benchmark, enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction.
